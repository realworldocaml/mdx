{0 Preludes}

Preludes are fragments of code that can be evaluated ahead of running the
code in OCaml and OCaml toplevel MDX blocks. They can be used to globally
open modules, register toplevel printers, set some globals like
[Printexc.record_backtrace], you name it!

They are especially useful if you want to hide or share this kind of setup
phase, e.g. if you are writing polished documentation you want to publish
or you are using MDX to add tests in your mli files directly.
