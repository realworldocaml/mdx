Mdx can also understand ocaml code blocks:

% $MDX version=4.02
\begin{ocaml}
# #require "fmt";;
# let x = 3;;
val x : int = 3
# x + "foo";;
Characters 4-9:
Error: This expression has type bytes but an expression was expected of type
         int
\end{ocaml}

% $MDX version=4.06
\begin{ocaml}
# #require "fmt";;
# let x = 3;;
val x : int = 3
# x + "foo";;

% $MDX version=4.07
\begin{ocaml}

val x : int = 3
# x + "foo";;
Characters 4-9:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type
         int
\end{ocaml}
