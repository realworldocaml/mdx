We can sync from the md to files with MDX comments:

<!-- $MDX write,file=data.json -->
```json
{ "value": 42 }
```

```sh
$ cat data.json
{ "value": 42 }
```

OCaml code can be written, but is not executed:

<!-- $MDX write,file=test.ml -->
```ocaml
abcd + defg
```

```sh
$ cat test.ml
abcd + defg
```
