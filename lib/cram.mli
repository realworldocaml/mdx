(** Cram tests *)

type t = {
  command : string list;
  output : Output.t list;
  exit_code : int;
  vpad : int;
}
(** The type for cram tests. *)

(** {2 Accessors} *)

val exit_code : t -> int
(** [exit_code t] is [t]'s exit code. *)

val use_heredoc : t -> bool
(** [use_heredoc t] is true iff [t] uses the heredoc ['<<'] syntax. *)

val command_line : t -> string
(** [command_line t] is [t]'s command line. It either adds ['\'] at
   the end of each line of [t]'s command or do nothing is [t] uses the
   heredoc syntax. *)

(** {2 Parser} *)

val of_lines :
  syntax:Syntax.t -> loc:Block_location.t -> string list -> int * t list
(** [of_lines l] parses the commands [l]. It returns the optional
   whitespace padding. *)

(** {2 Pretty-printer} *)

val pp : ?pad:int -> t Fmt.t
(** [pp] is the pretty-printer for cram tests. [pad] is the size of
   the optional whitespace left padding (by default it is 0). *)

val dump : t Fmt.t
(** [dump] it the printer for dumping cram tests. Useful for debugging. *)

val pp_command : ?pad:int -> t Fmt.t
(** [pp_command] pretty-prints cram commands. *)

val pp_exit_code : ?pad:int -> int Fmt.t
(** [pp_exit_code] pretty-prints exit code. *)
